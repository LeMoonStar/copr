here lives the spec files for my [copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sneexy/swayland/) which (will soon) hosts many applications, scripts, tools and utilities for (s)way/land based stuff.

## there is an issue with your packaging

send complaints to [sneexy@amogus.cloud](mailto:sneexy@amogus.cloud), or any other [contact method](https://sneexy.pages.gay/#socials). i'll try to reach and help!

## wtf are these spec files dawg

sorry, i don't know how to 'properly' make spec files yet. a lot of these are copy pasting previous ones then just modifying them to make a working build. i promise i'll try to learn more and actually make these better but for now any help or suggestions is great üôè

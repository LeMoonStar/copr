Automatically (hopefully) updated spec files for the [Floorp](https://floorp.app/) browser packaged for Fedora. Based on the works from [the4runner](https://github.com/the4runner/firefox-dev) and [LovecraftianGodsKiller](https://github.com/LovecraftianGodsKiller/floorp). The Copr repo for this package [can be located here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sneexy/floorp).

If you have any issues with the package itself, feel free to report but I may not be able to fix it as this is my first time managing a package such as this. Feel free to contribute if you'd like if you can fix any issues yourself!

This package *may or may not* be broken for users on Immutable/Atomic Fedora, although this issue may only be related to users using custom [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/)/[BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/) images. [You can see my fix here.](https://github.com/sernik-tech/member-images/blob/main/config/scripts/system-wuzetka.sh#L12-L16)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Note

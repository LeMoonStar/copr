Automatically up-to-date spec files for the [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) packaged for Fedora. Forked from my [Floorp](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sneexy/floorp) package, based on the works from [the4runner](https://github.com/the4runner/firefox-dev) and [LovecraftianGodsKiller](https://github.com/LovecraftianGodsKiller/floorp). The Copr repo for this package [can be located here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sneexy/zen-browser).

If you have any issues with the package itself, feel free to report but I may not be able to fix it as this is my first time managing a package such as this. Feel free to contribute if you'd like if you can fix any issues yourself!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Note
This is just an RPM packaging for the said software and does not include any licenses of its own. The only additional file included is the `.desktop` file written based on the original executable from the Firefox Release Channel (default).
